**Durant Drive Commercial Building** <span style="float: right;">*Beverly Hills, CA*</span>

- Designed the structural system for a 6-story mixed-use podium building with a concrete podium slab supporting 5 levels of wood framing and rooftop swimming pool above for lateral and vertical loads
- Performed finite element analysis using ETABS to evaluate slab’s load distribution, optimize the slab thickness and the column placement
- Collaborated with the MEP and architectural teams to integrate building systems within the structural design, coordinating penetrations in the podium slab for HVAC, plumbing & electrical services without compromising the load-carrying capacity
- Coordinated with geotechnical engineers to design and implement a mat foundation system for the building to ensure proper load transfer to the soil while addressing challenging soil conditions to prevent settlement and improve long-term stability

**American Cement Building Retrofit** <span style="float: right;">*Los Angeles, CA*</span>

- Performed Tier 3 analysis based on ASCE 41 using Linear Dynamic Procedures in ETABS for a 11-story concrete building
- Field investigated existing shear walls, floor framing, proposed elevators & escalators
- Analyzed existing shear walls & foundations and proposed retrofit schemes for presentation
- Implemented fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrap and steel bracing to improve the structural resilience against lateral load
- Coordinated with architects, property owner and other parties, prepared exhibits for site investigation results and suggestions, summarized due diligence report for client’s review

**Log Cabin Refurbishment** <span style="float: right;">*West Hollywood, CA*</span>

- Performed an in-depth structural assessment of the existing wood shear walls, roof beams, and floor joists using RISA to model the behavior of the wooden structure under wind and seismic loads
- Identified weak points in the log connections and upgraded the wood log connections by adding steel rods and epoxy injections at critical joints, preventing further splitting and enhancing load transfer between the wood trusses
- Improved the wood floor framing system by sistering deteriorated joists with new wood members and adding diagonal
bracing to enhance stiffness and reduce floor vibrations
- Collaborated with a team of preservation architects and heritage consultants to ensure all retrofit measures adhered to the National Register of Historic Places guidelines

**Hollywood Recreation Center** <span style="float: right;">*West Hollywood, CA*</span>

- Conducted detailed seismic frame analysis to determine the appropriate member sizes for a SCBF system and designed custom steel connections at bracing joints
- Collaborated closely with architects and engineering team to ensure that the SCBF system was strategically integrated into the building’s design without compromising functional space
- Performed in-depth linear dynamic analysis using RAM, validated the SCBF system’s ability to control lateral drift and deflection under seismic loading, and optimized the brace sizes and configurations to improve structural performance

**Cal State University Elephant Armature** <span style="float: right;">*Fullerton, CA*</span>

- Engineered and developed the internal steel armature for a life-sized elephant sculpture to resist wind and seismic forces while maintaining the aesthetic contours of the sculpture using RISA 3D
- Collaborated with artists and fabricators to integrate structural elements within the sculpture to ensure the precise alignment of the armature with the artistic design
